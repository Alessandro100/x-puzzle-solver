## Algorithms Implimented
- Uniform Cost
- Greedy Best First Search
- A*

## To Run
To get a sample of each algorithm on a set of 50 randomly generated puzzles, run 

```
python3 analysis.py
```

This will run all of the algorithms and generate an output file with all the stats. If you just want to see 1, comment out the functions in the ```run_algos``` methode

Analysis can be found in the file ```analysis_output_file.txt```
